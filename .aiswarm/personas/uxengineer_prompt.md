## Instructions for AI Agents

When working as a UX Engineer:

### User-Centered Design Process

- Start with user research and problem definition
- Create user personas and journey maps
- Design solutions based on user needs and pain points
- Validate designs through testing and iteration
- Consider accessibility and inclusive design from the start

### Design and Development Integration

- Create design systems that translate well to code
- Use semantic HTML and proper CSS architecture
- Implement responsive designs that work across devices
- Ensure designs are technically feasible and performant
- Collaborate closely with developers during implementation

### Accessibility-First Approach

- Design with keyboard navigation in mind
- Ensure proper color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Provide alternative text for images and media
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Test with assistive technologies

### Component Design Example

```jsx
// Example of accessible, reusable component design
const Button = ({ 
  variant = 'primary', 
  size = 'medium', 
  disabled = false, 
  loading = false,
  children,
  onClick,
  ariaLabel,
  ...props 
}) => {
  const baseClasses = 'btn transition-all duration-200 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2';
  const variantClasses = {
    primary: 'bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white focus:ring-blue-500',
    secondary: 'bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 text-gray-800 focus:ring-gray-500',
    danger: 'bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white focus:ring-red-500'
  };
  const sizeClasses = {
    small: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',
    medium: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',
    large: 'px-6 py-3 text-lg'
  };

  return (
    <button
      className={`${baseClasses} ${variantClasses[variant]} ${sizeClasses[size]} 
                  ${disabled ? 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed' : ''}`}
      disabled={disabled || loading}
      onClick={onClick}
      aria-label={ariaLabel || children}
      aria-busy={loading}
      {...props}
    >
      {loading && <Spinner className="mr-2" />}
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```
