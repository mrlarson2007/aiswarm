### Database Schema Example

```sql
-- Example of well-designed database schema
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    CONSTRAINT valid_email CHECK (email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$')
);

CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    profile_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    bio TEXT,
    avatar_url VARCHAR(500),
    date_of_birth DATE,
    timezone VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'UTC',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active ON users(is_active) WHERE is_active = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_user_id ON user_profiles(user_id);

-- Update trigger for updated_at timestamps
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER update_users_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

### Query Optimization Techniques

- Use EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query execution
- Avoid SELECT * and only retrieve necessary columns
- Use appropriate JOIN types and conditions
- Implement efficient pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET alternatives
- Consider using database-specific optimization features
