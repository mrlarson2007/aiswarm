## 🎯 Implementation Phases (Ready to Execute)

### Phase 1: Gemini CLI Fork (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Create independent `@aiswarm/gemini-cli` with A2A capabilities

**Key Deliverables**:
- Fork `google/gemini-cli` → `mrlarson2007/gemini-cli-aiswarm`
- Implement A2A client with task polling and processing
- NPM package `@aiswarm/gemini-cli` and Docker image
- Automated upstream sync strategy

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Forked Gemini CLI builds and runs independently
- [ ] A2A client connects to test A2A server successfully
- [ ] Task processing workflow functional end-to-end

### Phase 2: A2A Schema Migration (Weeks 2-3) 
**Goal**: Migrate AISwarm to A2A-compliant data schemas

**Key Deliverables**:
- A2A-compliant task and agent models
- Database migration with backward compatibility
- C# A2A SDK integration (`A2A` + `A2A.AspNetCore` packages)
- Legacy API wrapper for existing MCP tools

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Existing tasks migrated to A2A format successfully
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for all existing MCP tools
- [ ] A2A schema validation passes compliance tests

### Phase 3: Unified MCP+A2A Server (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Single binary with both MCP and A2A capabilities

**Key Deliverables**:
- Merge A2A functionality into `AISwarm.Server`
- MCP tools for A2A agent management (`LaunchGeminiAgent`, `ManageA2ATasks`)
- Production deployment with Docker Compose
- A2A protocol compliance validation

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] MCP and A2A protocols working in single server
- [ ] MCP tools can launch and manage A2A agents
- [ ] Single binary deployment successful

### Phase 4: Vector Embeddings (Weeks 4-5)
**Goal**: Context-aware task assignment using Microsoft Kernel Memory

**Key Deliverables**:
- Kernel Memory service integration (Docker + embedded modes)
- Vector-enhanced MCP tools for workspace indexing
- Context injection for improved code generation
- Local ONNX embeddings for zero cloud dependencies

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Vector search enhances task assignment quality
- [ ] Context injection measurably improves code generation
- [ ] Performance meets production requirements

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup master branch
git clone https://github.com/mrlarson2007/aiswarm.git
cd aiswarm
git checkout master

# Transfer implementation files
cp -r docs/implementation/ ./docs/
cp -r src/AISwarm.Shared/Models/A2A/ ./src/AISwarm.Shared/Models/
cp -r scripts/ ./
