## Code Review: AISwarm.DataLayer

### Overall Assessment:
The `AISwarm.DataLayer` is a well-designed and implemented component, demonstrating good practices in data modeling, database interaction, and transaction management.

### Key Strengths:
*   **Data Model:** Entities (`Agent`, `WorkItem`, `TaskPriority`, `TaskStatus`) are well-defined and accurately represent the domain.
*   **Database Interactions:** The `DatabaseScopeService` provides a robust pattern for managing database access and transactions using `TransactionScope`.
*   **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns, use of interfaces, and well-structured code contribute to high maintainability.

### Areas for Improvement:
*   **Complete `WorkItem` Test Coverage:** Expand CRUD and entity-specific tests for `WorkItem` across `CoordinationDbContextTests.cs`, `DatabaseScopeTests.cs`, and a new `WorkItemEntityTests.cs`.
*   **Explicit Enum Persistence Tests:** Add tests to `CoordinationDbContextTests.cs` to verify correct string persistence and retrieval of `AgentStatus` and `TaskPriority` enums.
*   **Concurrency Testing (Advanced):** Consider more advanced concurrency tests for scenarios like multiple agents claiming the same task, especially with a real database.
