# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the AI Swarm Agent Launcher grows in complexity, we need a systematic way to document architectural decisions. Without proper documentation of the reasoning behind design choices, future maintainers (including ourselves) will struggle to understand why certain patterns were chosen.

Key challenges we face:
- Understanding past design decisions when modifying code
- Ensuring consistency in architectural patterns across the codebase
- Communicating design rationale to team members and contributors
- Avoiding repeated debates on settled architectural questions

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant architectural decisions in this project.

ADRs will:
- Follow the standard ADR format (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences)
- Be stored in `/docs/adr/` directory 
- Be numbered sequentially (ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.)
- Be written in Markdown format
- Be committed to version control alongside the code changes they document

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Better Documentation**: Future developers can understand the reasoning behind architectural choices
- **Consistent Patterns**: Documented decisions help maintain consistency across the codebase
- **Reduced Repeated Discussions**: Settled decisions are recorded, preventing re-litigation
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can quickly understand architectural principles

### Negative

- **Additional Overhead**: Writing ADRs requires time and discipline
- **Maintenance Burden**: ADRs need to be kept up-to-date when decisions change

### Neutral

- **Review Process**: ADRs become part of the code review process for architectural changes
- **Living Documentation**: ADRs evolve with the codebase rather than becoming stale external documentation
